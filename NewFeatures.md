# New Features Plan (post-refactor)

> Companion to `RefactorPlan.md`. The refactor restructures *existing* behaviour; this file tracks
> *new* gameplay/engine features added on top of the refactored model. Same conventions: each
> top-level item is a *cluster* of 1-2 tightly-coupled sub-tasks; work top to bottom; a cluster is
> `[x]` only once every sub-item under it is `[x]`.
>
> Before starting a feature, read `STATE.md` for the current package map and established contracts,
> and reuse them rather than redesigning. Build/verify with `./mvnw test` (vendored toolchain in
> `tools/`; see `tools/AgentWorkflow.md`).

## [ ] A. Audio (SFX + music)
> Moved here from `RefactorPlan.md` (was the audio half of the old "Audio & Final Integration"
> cluster) — sound is a new feature on top of the refactored engine, not part of the migration.
- [ ] Implement a `SoundManager` with a small `javax.sound.sampled` clip pool so overlapping SFX
      (shots, hits/captures, explosions) don't cut each other off or stutter. Load clips once and
      reuse; fail soft (log + continue) when a sound asset is missing. Wire SFX triggers into the
      existing decoupled event hooks (e.g. `DiscSystem.DiscEventSink` capture-hit / disc-retire) so
      audio stays decoupled from physics and rendering.
